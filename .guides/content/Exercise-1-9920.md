## Lists Exercise 1

**Problem**
Write a program that takes a list of integers called `numbers` and replaces each element greater than 10 with a `'*'`. Print the new version of `numbers`.

**Expected Output**
* If `numbers = [30, 1, 20, 4]` then you will print `['*', 1, '*', 4]`
* If `numbers = [5, 9, 11, 23]` then you will print `[5, 9, '*', '*']`

  <summary><strong>Hint</strong></summary>
  Using the iteration variable alone is not sufficient to change the element of a list. You need to be able to access the <strong>index</strong> of the iteration variable to modify the element.

**Important**
Do not edit the code in the top section. This code is necessary for the auto-grader to work. Add your code in the section below. 

**Testing Your Code**
The `TEST 1` button will test your code with `numbers = [30, 1, 20, 4]`. The `TEST 2` button will test your code with `numbers = [5, 9, 11, 23]`

  <summary><strong>Where is the code visualizer?</strong></summary>
  Unfortunately, the code visualizer does not work with the statement <code>import sys</code>. Since importing the <code>sys</code> module is required for this problem, the code visualizer will not be available for this problem.
