## Lists Exercise 4

**Problem**
Write a program that takes a list called `numbers` that contains integers in a sequence (the sequence is always increasing, never decreasing). Your program should add the next two numbers in the sequence, and then print the list.

**Expected Output**
* If `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]` then you will print `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
* If `numbers = [-5, -4, -3, -2]` then you will print `[-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0]`

**Important**
Do not edit the code in the top section. This code is necessary for the auto-grader to work. Add your code in the section below. 

**Testing Your Code**
The `TEST 1` button will test your code with `numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]`. The `TEST 2` button will test your code with `numbers = [-5, -4, -3, -2]`.
