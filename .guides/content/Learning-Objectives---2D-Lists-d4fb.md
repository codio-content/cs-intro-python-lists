## Assumptions
Students are familiar with lists and their indexes. They are also comfortable with nested loops.

## Limitations
This section does not go over each of the individual topics for regular lists (methods, operators, etc.). There is a page that brings to light how manipulating 2D lists require some extra thought, but it is not a comprehensive list of all of the use cases. There is an example where the string function `len` is referenced even though strings are the topic of the next unit. The similarities between the length function for lists and strings is close enough that students should not have too much trouble making sense of it.
